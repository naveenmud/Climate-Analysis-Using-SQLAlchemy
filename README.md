## Project Overview
This project seeks to do climate analysis to help plan for a trip to Honolulu, Hawaii. First, Python and SQLAlchemy were used to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. Then I looked at precipitation and weather station data to find the best locations and time of year to visit.
